Selenium : It's a web based automation tool/library.

Types of applications
-----------------------
1) web applications: need internet to operate, e.g. Facebook, Instagram.
2) Desktop applications: don't need internet to operate, e.g. Calculator, Ms word, Ms excel.
3) Mobile applications

Advantages
-----------
1> Open source tool & free
2> Supports Multiple operating systems
3> Supports multiple browsers (cross browser testing)
4> Supports multiple languages(java, python, c#, Ruby, js etc)
5) Integrate third party tools into selenium.

Limitations
------------
1) Cannot support windows based applications(Autoit, Sikuli, Robot APT)
2) Reporting not supported( TestNG, Extent reports)
3) cannot support excel files(Apache poi)
4) graphs , captua


Java Programing
--------------
Java : Object Oriented Programing languages

types of programing languages
----------------------------
1> structured: C, python
2> Object based: VB, VBScript, python
3> Object Oriented: C++, Java, C#, python

Oops
------
1> Class
2> Object
3> Inheritance
4> Polymorphism
5> Abstraction
6> Encapsulation

Features
--------
1> Platform independent
2> Case Sensitive

Components
------------
1. JDK : Java Development Kit (full-featured software development kit for java, including everything
    in JRE plus tools for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java applications).
2. JRE : Java Runtime Environment (provides the libraries and JVM requried to run Java applications)
3. JVM : Java Virtual Machine ( Enables your computer to run Java programs by converting
    bytecode into machine-specific code)

Class and Objects
------------------
- Class is a collection of varibales and methods.
- Object is an instance of class.
- eg: Animal is a class and Dog, Cow, Lion are objects.

Class
------
1. Class is collection of variables and methods.
2. Class is logical entry and blueprint.
3. Will not occupy any space in memory.

Object
-------
1. Object is an instance of class/ object will be created by using class.
2. Object is a physical entity.
3. Object takes space in memory.
4. we can create multiple objects from a single class and all are independent of each other.

Selenium web Driver Locators
-----------------------------
-> As part of Automation, Selenium Performs action(such as click, typing) on the Page HTML elements.
-> The locators are the way to identify an HTML element on a web page.
-> Selenium webDriver uses any of the below locators to identify the elements on the page an perforoms the Action.
    1. ID
    2. Xpath
    3. css selector
    4. Name
    5. Class Name
    6. Tag Name
    7. Link Text
    8. Partial Link Text

CSS selector
------------
-> Class name : tagname.classname -> button.signInBtn -> .error
-> id -> tagname#id -> input#username
-> tagname[attribute='value'] : input[placeholder='username']
-> if mutiple elements have same attribute than we access through indexing
    tagname[attribute='value']:nth-child(index)
-> for traverssing through parent child
    "ParentTagname childTagname"
-> for regular expression
    input[type*='pass'] : this return element contains the word 'pass' in its type attribute




Xpath
------
-> //tagname[@attribute='value'] : //input[@placeholder='username']
-> if mutiple elements have same attribute than we access through indexing
    //tagname[@attribute='value'] -> "//input[@type='text'][1]"
-> for traverssing through parent child
    //parentTganem/childTagname/childTagname...
-> for regular expression
    //button[contains(@class, 'submit')]
