Test suite -> test folder (module) -> test cases

You can define multiple test cases from the single class.
You can modularize the testcases based upon functionality and trigger them accordingly.
You can also customize the selection of particular function to be included or excluded.


-> include : if include is used in the method section than only those functions will run and other will not run.
-> exclude: if exclude is present than the suite will run all the functions except the once mentioned in exclude

-> If both used together, include has higher priority and after all the functions included , exclude will be performed on
    those functions only.
-> If there are other function as well which are not included than its automatically excluded anyway.
-> We can also use regex in include and exclude methods

**-> The order of execution for same level of test depends on alphabetical order.

        Key takeaways (remember this)
=============================================
1. @Parameters must match method arguments
2. Parameters are not auto-injected
3. <test> parameters override <suite>
4. Private @Test methods will NOT run
5. @Optional can be used to avoid failures
6. We have to provide parameter above every function that we use the arguments.
